# Feedback - IT Skills Assessment

The IT skill assessment is used every six months as part of the Feedback process to assess you on your **influence**, it is used across both hard skills (technical) and soft skills to see how much influence you have over your peers, team, department, company and the wider community.

We value the influence in individuals as it encourages a learning organization, as such if you are a goto resource for Automated Testing it shows that you have attained certain level of knowledge and respect in the team and are helping to share that. If that same knowledge is used by the entire department then it shows an even great level of knowledge and respect because your sphere of influence is even greater.
