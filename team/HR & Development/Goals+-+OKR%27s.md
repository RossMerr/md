# Goals - OKR's

It's recommended to follow the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) model of goal setting, for a introduction see google's re:Work for a source of information.

## Individual Goals 

To help everyone define individual goals the loveOS leadership has some high level goals for the which you should use to align around the team's needs (Team Goals - KPIs Used to Measure Towards Business Goal).

Individual goals should be regularly reviewed with your line manager to check on your progress or any blockers, we recommend setting between 3-5 Objectives, for Key Results you will want about 3 per objective with the outcomes being measurable.

Individual goals should be set and refreshed after every Feedback round with you line manager. Using the IT Skill Matrix you and your line manager can set goals for areas of developments. This will ensure they can make the resources available such as time, training or money depending on the goals.

Any progression or development then made over your individual goals should help you progress in the next Feedback round.

Individual Goals are then shared in Confluence across the team for everyone to see.

## Personal Development Goals

Outside of the individual goals that are set with your line manager you should also have personal goals. Setting these are your responsibility and are for you to use to developer yourself. 

Personal goals are useful for helping define a long term strategy of how you want to progress your career and so you should align with your manager after setting any, that way they know when relevant project become available they can give you the opportunity to follow that objective.

Personal Goals are kept private between you and your line manager.
