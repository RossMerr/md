# Hiring

## New to IT hiring in Spark Networks?

You will first need to shadow someone who is already experienced with our recruiting, this could be a individual step or the entire flow. After shadowing the corresponding step or the entire flow you are expected to participate. When the recruiter is confident they will then just shadow you, letting you do the entire step or flow. After this you should be ready to do recruitment unsupervised.

## Human Resources 

The recruiting team in HR maintain our Job's, this is currently in Workable were they actively source for open positions and work with external recruiters, liaise with the candidates and prepare the job offers/contracts.

Any new external recruiters must be negotiated by HR with our stand terms. Normally this is limited to three different sources, however it must be ensured that a budget is available for external recruiters.

## External Recruiters

When working with external recruiters or HR for any active sourcing, we must provide them clear and regular feedback for each candidate., this is to ensure recruiters can continually improve and so they know we are actively pursuing this position (If they get no feedback and so can't fill any positions they will normally abandon a role after a few weeks). When onboarding a new recruiters a briefing of the job must be done and monthly refreshes to ensure the recruiters stays upto date.
