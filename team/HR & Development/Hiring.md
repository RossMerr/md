# Hiring

## New to IT hiring?

You will first need to shadow someone who is already experienced with our recruiting, this could be a individual step or the entire flow. After shadowing the corresponding step or the entire flow you are expected to participate. When the recruiter is confident they will then just shadow you, letting you do the entire step or flow. After this you should be ready to do recruitment unsupervised.

### Human Resources 

The recruiting team in HR maintain our Job's, this is currently in Workable were they actively source for open positions and work with external recruiters, liaise with the candidates and prepare the job offers/contracts.

Any new external recruiters must be negotiated by HR with our stand terms. Normally this is limited to three different sources, however it must be ensured that a budget is available for external recruiters.

### External Recruiters

When working with external recruiters or HR for any active sourcing, we must provide them clear and regular feedback for each candidate., this is to ensure recruiters can continually improve and so they know we are actively pursuing this position (If they get no feedback and so can't fill any positions they will normally abandon a role after a few weeks). When onboarding a new recruiters a briefing of the job must be done and monthly refreshes to ensure the recruiters stays upto date.

## The Flow

### 1. Supply Channel Management

There are many supply channels for hiring.  The most successful channels tend to be meetups, conferences, referrals, and recruiters

All supply channels must be trained / briefed constantly, and worked with to ensure that they are not dropping out awesome ‘outliers’ from the screening process (very good often also get dropped as well as very bad).
CV's are useless; have the recruiter talk to the person about the type of things we are looking for in a candidates, and have them self select on whether they're suitable or not for the role.  This includes having a briefing sheet. 

Keep the fishing rod in the river! Don’t stop, even when there are no spaces to be filled.  Really, really good people come along infrequently, so keep your recruiters and people briefed to send people, even when not looking

*For Conferences,* developers should attend and talk to other devs ‘unvarnished’, but be briefed and involved in deciding what good looks like when it comes to hiring tech folks.  You can tell by talking to someone whether they share the same outlook on what we consider good to look like.  So, the devs should know what the company's view is, and that it aligns to their own.

*For meetups,* devs will come speak to other devs when they see a cool thing in a coding kata, or hear about good things about your company at the bar.  Capitalize on that, be prepared for that.  Also be prepared to offer incentives for people actively doing this.

*For referrals,* look at intrinsic and extrinsic motivators.  Sure, we will offer a bonus if we successfully hire a friend referred to the company, but you'll also get the comfort in knowing that awesome people have been hired.

*For recruiters,* constantly work with them to refine what exactly looks good for the org.  When they are unsure, they shouldn’t drop them out, but consult you.  
Often recruiters are the public face of the company, so they need to be very well briefed to represent our brand properly (including everyone knowing the hiring process, and potentially extrinsic rewards for hiring).
In active periods you should have 3 or 4 recruiters actively looking, and never sign any exclusivity deals, as they tend to reduce the variety of people found. 
Recruiters also have to be actively managed, and you should swap out for a new supplier any company who:

* Doesn't represent our brand properly
* Fails to perform on sourcing appropriate candidates
* Generates a significant amount of work for us.  Simply firing through CV's and expecting us to do all the filtering is not them doing their job. 

Most importantly, actively monitor what channel people are coming from, and how much the total spend is in terms of effort and money.  This gives you a better view on how effective channels are in certain circumstances.  
For example, if recruiters are the most expensive, and least labour intensive, use them more when you really need to hire quickly and can buy speed.  If conferences are the cheapest, and moderate in terms of pricing, use them more to find great candidates when pressure isn't as great.

### 2. About the Company and Process

This is the first time someone really speaks with a company employee, and these impressions are lasting.  Explain the company's market position, the goals, and generally it's successful and profitable (high level, not detailed).  Explain the steps in the process and that we'll send a follow up email also describing it.  Also, elaborate on team culture, and what it feels like to be part of the team.

### 3. Coding Exercise

The coding exercise is designed to illustrate a person's coding ability, not whether they are good at a particular framework or not.  
Being able to adequately cover the code in tests and automatically deploy it is something that is looked for.  

### 4. Sprint in a Day

This is the main practical part of the hiring process.  It's designed to be pressured.  How someone copes with pressure is something we test.
The idea is that the candidate extends the existing solution they supplied as the coding exercise.  
This requires the Product Manager and person who is pairing with the candidate to look at the existing exercise in order to extend.

The actual day starts with the Affinitas engineer and Product Manager meeting with the candidate to give them the schedule for the day.

This consists roughly of the following:

* Intros (Hi I'm the PM, developer etc); 10 mins
* Introduction of PM's requirements (which should take 4 or 5 days to complete the proposed work); 15 mins
* Negotiation of scope, and breaking down of User Stories: 1 hour
* Offer a break: 10 mins
* Pair Programming; 1 hr or so
* Lunch with the team: offer 1 hr, but make it a bit longer
* Pair Programming - 2 hrs or so
* Demo at 3.30pm with PM

Some select engineers are asked to have lunch with the candidate (a moderate one, which should be expensed) in order to see how they behave in a social situation.  
The idea is also to try and extend the lunch a little to see how the candidate deals with it; will they ask to go back, excuse themselves, or carry on with the team?

The candidate only really has 3 hrs of coding, so seeing how they manage their own time is essential.  If they do this badly, this isn't an immediate fail, but might indicate level of seniority. 

As part of the exercise the pair (i.e. the Affinitas engineer) should be active; asking questions on what has been coded, what the candidate is thinking.
The main role, really, of the Affinitas engineer is to try and get some insight into how the person thinks, what kind of architectural style they prefer etc.

At the end, when the hiring group is talking about the candidate, they are then offered the chance to go speak further with the team while the group talks about the candidates' technical abilities.

#### 4.1. Behavioural and Attitude Assessment

If the candidate is successful at this leg, they're then invited to a behavioural and attitude assessment at 4pm.  
This is basically to whether the person has a self-starter attitude, and whether they can be a driving force in a team.

#### 4.2. Offer

The paperwork for the offer should be prepared before the end of the day, in order for the candidate to leave with something firm at the end of the day.
