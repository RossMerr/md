# One-on-one

Each developer should have time with their line manager for one-on-one's to give and receive feedback, this should be biweekly and organized as part of the onboarding by the manager. Thirty-minute meetings is rule of thumb but not a hard-fast requirement.

* Employee sets the agenda, not the manager
* Discuss personal development.
* Raise concerns and issues. 
* Discuss performance issues.
