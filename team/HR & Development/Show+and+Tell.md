# Show and Tell

The Show & Tell is a meeting that allows us to celebrate teams' work and talk about what we've learned.

Also, it's a very good moment to:

* Bring the team together, helping stakeholders and others bond with the team by sharing success and improving collaboration.
* Let teams you’re working with know what you’re up to, highlight progress where dependencies exist and keep teams connected.
* Tell stakeholders what you’ve been doing and take their questions and feedback — a form of governance.

This is a regular meeting that will take place every Friday from 4:00-5:00 (ideally).

Use this space for:

* Demo of recently delivered features.
* Demo of features in progress.
* Research projects.
* Share insights and learnings from recent experiences.
