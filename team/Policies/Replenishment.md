# Replenishment

## Purpose

Kanban is a pull system. if you don't feed it regularly with work that can be pulled at some point you'll have what we call "starvation". So, the purpose of replenishment is to keep the system flowing and always with options that you can pull into the Work In Progress area.

## Cadence

According to the team's cycle. The recommended minimum cycle is one week.

## Responsibility

It's a team responsibility to avoid "starvation" and always keep the input queue with a reasonable amount of work candidates. Product and Tech Managers can provide support to the team on getting into the habit, but ultimately it's a team responsibility to feed the system.

## Balance

Remember to balance the types of work (regular work, bugs, technical debt) you're selecting for the week.

## Work In Progress Limits

Remember, the WIP limit is there to help us achieve flow. Too much work started in parallel means too much work in progress which means too much waste (unfinished work) and multi-tasking.
