# Summary

Brief explanation of the change.


# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What is the expected outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.


# Possible solutions

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?


# Chosen solution

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the change in detail. This should get into specifics and corner-cases and include examples when it makes sense. Any new terminology should be defined here.


# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:
- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- cost of migration, breaking changes
- the impact on teaching developers

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.


# Adoption strategy

What needs to happen if we want to adopt this RFC? Clearly define the following points:
* Outline of the execution plan (bullet points)
* What resources are needed (people, time, etc)?
* Are there any risks?

If you have difficulties to define those points, ask your colleagues for help (including Managers, Directors, etc).


# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
